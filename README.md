Mechanical arm synchronization: An imitation of human arm action

My project name is ‘Mechanical arm synchronization: An imitation of human arm action’. (Please check my FYP Demo video at YouTube: https://youtu.be/6-MdcxJDVI8) This project will use two cameras to video human arm action. This data(arm posture images) will be analyzed by the proposed system and the mechanical arm could mimic human arm action.(More project details please find my github:) 
 
Recently, I am studying machine learning which could improve the level of image processing. I also made some progress about the motion planning on my mechanical arm.(More details please find: )
